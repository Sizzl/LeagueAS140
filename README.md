# LeagueAS140
Compile-able headers for LeagueAS140, an Assault mod for Unreal Tournament '99.

NOTE: Compiling this will not result in a playable mod. This is to be used for mutator / mod development that wishes to interact more closely with LeagueAS140, or extend it's functionality.

Not all classes are included here, but the majority are for most modification scenarios.

Some code is included where it makes sense to have it, but the majority of functions and states are outlined for illustration only.

# Common sense reminder
Compiling this will result in a mismatch with a working release of LeagueAS140, therefore ensure your development environment is separate from your playing environment.
